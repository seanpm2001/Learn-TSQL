-- About:
-- I decided to make TSQL the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-TSQL) as TSQL is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the TSQL programming language. It only makes sense to TSQL the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
